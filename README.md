# SingleShop Assignment
My attempt to rebuild the SingleShop Phones page.

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:storkontheroof/singleshop-assignment.git

# install dependencies (uses Lerna to install in web & api packages too)
$ npm install

# serve web with hot reload at localhost:3000 and 
# serve api in watch mode at localhost:3001
$ npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000
